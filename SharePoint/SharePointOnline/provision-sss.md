# Overview of the SharePoint Success Site 

The SharePoint Success Site is a ready to deploy and customizable SharePoint communication site that helps your organization maximize the adoption of SharePoint. The SharePoint Success Site is designed to support new SharePoint site owners in creating high-impact sites to meet the goals of your organization. Install the SharePoint Success Site in your tenant environment, customize the pre-populated training content, and make it available to end users.

If you are already using M365 learning pathways and don't want to provision the site, you can upload the [SharePoint Success Site playlist into learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/add-sss-cdn).


### Why invest in a SharePoint Success Site?
The SharePoint Success Site helps site owners improve the quality and impact of the sites they build in SharePoint for internal audiences, while helping ensure they follow your organization’s site usage guidelines. 

Use the SharePoint Success Site to:

- **Get more out of SharePoint** - Teach new site owners how to utilize the power behind SharePoint's communication and collaboration features. 
- **Enable site owners to create high-impact sites** - Ensure site owners have the right information and support to create purposeful sites that are widely adopted by the intended audience. 
- **Ensure site owners follow site creation policies** - Customize the site creation policy page on your SharePoint Success site to communicate organizational policy expectations early.
- **Provide the most up-to-date content** - Equip site owners with SharePoint self-help content that is maintained by Microsoft and published as SharePoint evolves.

#### Microsoft 365 learning pathways
When you provision the SharePoint Success Site, you will first be required to install [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/). M365 learning pathways connects to a Microsoft-maintained content repository that includes publicly available SharePoint help content. As the content repository is updated, M365 learning pathways will automatically display updated SharePoint content. With M365 learning pathways, you can also create targeted training playlists that meet the needs of your organization beyond SharePoint training by uploading custom playlists. 

![Image of the Microsoft 365 learning pathways solution](media/sss-m365-learning-pathways.png)

#### Microsoft-maintained content feed
The SharePoint Success Site’s up-to-date content feed includes a range of content that helps new users and existing site owners plan, build, and manage SharePoint sites:

- **Plan your site:** Guidance on how to plan a site, including what type of SharePoint site to use, access rights, and permission strategy.
- **Create your site:** Content that helps new site owners create their site, including how to brand and customize their site and how to add content.
- **Share and manage your site:** Guidance to help launch, share, and manage the new site.
- **Advanced site creation:** Content for site owners that want to learn beyond site creation basics.

#### Site inspiration
The introductory section helps new site owners understand the different ways you can leverage SharePoint to meet a business objective. Users will have access to stories that illustrate how to build an onboarding site, a project management site, a site that supports a community of interest, and a team collaboration site. These scenarios provide guidance on how to think about the planning, building, and launching phases.

![Image of the Ways to work with SharePoint page](media/sss-ways-to-work.png)


#### Success stories
The success stories section is a gallery to showcase internal SharePoint site success stories that inspire others in the organization. Learn how to create a [Microsoft Form](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-form-with-microsoft-forms-4ffb64cc-7d5d-402f-b82e-b1d49418fd9d#:~:text=%20Create%20a%20form%20with%20Microsoft%20Forms%20,names%20can%20contain%20up%20to%2090...%20More%20) to solicit success stories from site owners and authors, and publish on your SharePoint Success Site to inspire.

![Image of the Success Stories page](media/sss-success-stories.png)

#### Site creation guidelines 
The site creation guidelines page provides a starting point to educate new site authors about [SharePoint creation policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/sites-usage-guidelines) for your organization. The guidelines include suggested usage policy topics and questions to prompt consideration of usage policies within your organization. Customize the content in your SharePoint Success Site site creation guidelines page to serve your organization’s governance needs.

## Step 1: Provision the SharePoint Success Site
An Office 365 tenant administrator can start the provisioning process for the SharePoint Success Site. Before getting started, make sure you've met the prerequisites for provisioning.

### Prerequisites
To successfully set up the SharePoint Success Site in your tenant you must install it using the Admin success center. Meet the prerequisites for both the person provisioning and the tenant before you begin:

<br>

| Tenant admin role | +  | Collection owner of the App Catalog | +  |V4 or higher of M365 learning pathways | = | Ready to provision         |
| :----------------: | :----------------: |:-------------:|:----------------: | :----------------: |:-------------:| :-------------:|


The **person** doing the provisioning must meet the following pre-requisites:
- Must be a tenant administrator of the tenant - also known as the Office 365 global administrator role - where the SharePoint Success Site will be provisioned. If you are not sure if you have been assigned the global administrator role, please see our troubleshooting steps.
- The person provisioning the SharePoint Success Site must be a site collection owner of the App Catalog. If the person provisioning the SharePoint Success Site is not a site collection owner of the App Catalog, [complete these instructions to continue](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/addappadmin).
	
The **tenant** must meet the following provisioning pre-requisites:
- A SharePoint App Catalog must be available within your tenant environment. If your organization does not have a SharePoint App Catalog, refer to the [SharePoint Online documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) to create one.
- Your tenant must have **version 4.0 or higher** of M365 learning pathways. If you need to [upgrade your version](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_update) or determine what version of M365 learning pathways you have review the documentation. If you need to install M365 learning pathways go to the [M365LP solution page](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_provision) and review documentation for set up and configuration. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you need to create a SharePoint App Catalog, wait at least 30 minutes after creating before provisioning M365 learning pathways and the SharePoint Success Site. 


### Where to get started provisioning 

Your tenant's configuration will determine what path you need to take to install the SharePoint Success Site. First, you need to have [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/3df8bd55-b872-4c9d-88e3-6b2f05344239) version 4.0 or higher installed in your tenant. If your tenant already has M365 learning pathways installed, ensure you are using **version 4.0 or higher**. Then, you can provision the SharePoint Success Site from the Admin success center.

#### Customize specific web parts

**1. Yammer conversations web part** - Use a Yammer web part to connect new SharePoint site owners with extra support from SharePoint site owners and admins. Connect your Yammer account to the [Yammer conversations web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da#conversations).

![Image of the Yammer conversations web part](media/sss-yammer.png)

**2. People web part** - Edit the [People web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/show-people-profiles-on-your-page-with-the-people-web-part-7e52c5f6-2d72-48fa-a9d3-d2750765fa05) to display contact information so new site owner can reach out for help.

![Image of the People web part](media/sss-people.png)

![Image of the Forms web part](media/sss-form.png)

#### Customize the Success stories page
The success stories section is a gallery for organizations to showcase internal SharePoint Online success stories that inspire others in the organization. 

![Image of an example success story](media/sss-success-story-example.png)

If available, add SharePoint success stories to your portal. If there are no ready-to-publish success stories, consider working with internal partners to create SharePoint successes by building high priority sites that align with business outcomes. Highlighting these “early wins” will help inspire others in the organization on the possibilities for using SharePoint themselves to achieve important business outcomes. 

Here are some sample questions to consider using in your form:

- Name of solution 
- Project team members 
- Who is the sponsor of the project? 
- What Microsoft 365 technologies (e.g., SharePoint, Yammer, Stream, Flow) were used as part of the solution? 
- What were the reasons for building the SharePoint site/solution? 
- Provide a description of the solution 
- What impact or results has the SharePoint site/solution generated? 
- What best practices for planning and implementing your solution would you recommend to other who are building their own SharePoint site/solution? 

Learn more about how to [create a form](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-form-with-microsoft-forms-4ffb64cc-7d5d-402f-b82e-b1d49418fd9d) using Microsoft Forms.


#### Customize the Site creation guidelines page
To ensure the proper use of SharePoint in your organization it is important to communicate your site usage guidelines to new and existing site owners. This should include guidelines for how people should create sites in your tenant, design standards, and how people should share information using SharePoint and Office 365. 

![Image of the site creation guidelines page](media/sss-creation-guidelines.png)

The example site creation and usage guidelines are not intended to be a final policy document. Once you have created your own unique usage guidelines, remove the content from the Site usage guidelines page and replace it with your organization’s usage guidelines. See how to [create and use modern pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-use-modern-pages-on-a-sharepoint-site-b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) on a SharePoint site. 

Create site usage guidelines that are appropriate for your organization by reviewing our [site usage guidelines checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/sites-usage-guidelines) that will help you create guidelines that:

- Inspire discussion and consideration amongst your stakeholders on important site usage policies
- Provide links to resources that can help you better understand the options related to key policy decisions
- Provide sample text to get you started in creating your own policies

Here are some topics to consider as you create your own site creation and usage guidelines:

- How to get a new SharePoint site
- Guidelines for using site templates
- Site design, branding, and customization
- Rules for sharing and permissions
- Capacity guidelines
- Site lifecycle policy


#### Provide contact information for SharePoint support
If your organization has an intranet team that will be supporting site owners, consider profiling the intranet team members on the SharePoint Success Site homepage using the People web part. 
The home page of the SharePoint Success Site has a [People web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/show-people-profiles-on-your-page-with-the-people-web-part-7e52c5f6-2d72-48fa-a9d3-d2750765fa05?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) you can use to add your own Intranet team. If you will not have a dedicated team supporting site owners, remove the current People web part.


## Step 3: Share the SharePoint Success Site with end-users
Partner with others in your organization to ensure the SharePoint Success Site is widely known and adopted. 

Key success factors to managing the SharePoint Success Site:

- Celebrate the launch of your SharePoint Success Site
- Create and post news announcing the new resource
- Ensure users have an outlet for questions and feedback
- Plan to review the SharePoint Success site as needed to ensure content and site usage policies are still relevant 
- Build culture and community by integrating a [Yammer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da#conversations).

#### Adoption and awareness strategy

To help build, grow, and sustain your SharePoint adoption efforts, its recommended to [create a SharePoint user group community in Yammer](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-group-in-yammer-b407af4f-9a58-4b12-b43e-afbb1b07c889).  Your SharePoint champions and power users can answer SharePoint related questions posted in the Yammer group and encourage site owners to share their successes and best practices. See the [champions guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/champ_findthem) for more information on how to identify and build a successful champions program. To increase visibility and engagement within your portal champions community, integrate the Yammer group hosting your community into the SharePoint Success Site using the [Yammer conversations web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da).
